# Heads up!
- ## **There is use of 2 datapacks I HAVE to give credit to the owners who both are...**
- ### **[VanillaTweaks  Team](https://vanillatweaks.net/about/) [(TPA datapack)](https://vanillatweaks.net/picker/datapacks/)**
- ### **[PuckiSilver](https://modrinth.com/user/PuckiSilver) [(Keep Some Inventory Datapack)](https://modrinth.com/datapack/keep-some-inventory)**
## Anyways...
### This mod adds:
- ### Commands. (Like what did you expect, actual modded items or smth?)
  - ### Said commands are /back (Teleport to latest death point.) and /tpa (There's more than 1 tpa command you can go in and check for yourself.)

~~I also have no care if you just dip this, I just want to show off my modding skills.~~ <- **This is a joke by the way. I really do care if you download this.** Also go show support to the VanillaTweaks team & PuckiSilver, They're what inspired me to make this in the first place.
